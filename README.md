# Phase-1-SA-03-Code-Challenge-Flatacuties
 
 
 This is an app for voting for the cutest animal! I have 
 used a local API and built out the frontend for our app, Flatacuties.





As a user, I can:

1. See all characters names in a `div` with the id of `"character-bar"`. Create
   a `span` tag with the character's name and add it the `div#character-bar`
   once you have retrieved the character data from the server. 

2. When the character in the `div#character-bar` is clicked, display the
   character's details in the `div#detailed-info`. 

3. When the `form#votes-form` is submitted, add the number of votes from
   the input field to the character displayed in the `div#detailed-info`. **No
   persistence is needed**.
